call constants and store likelihoods
determine prior probability

Divide the robots in half.
Send half the robots to one corner and half to another corner
Use a lawnmower search pattern and have the tanks work towards one another (set a constant velocity and take measurements every second or so)
	for each state si,j of the world
     observe oi,j from the set {hit, miss, no_data}
      update p(si,j = occupied | oi,j) = p(oi,j | si,j = occupied)p(si,j = occupied) / p(oi,j)
      add repulsion points
